This was a team project. I worked on the js.  
This responsive web app displays current weather and a 4-day forecast using the OpenWeatherMap API. Users can search cities or cycle through presets (Stockholm, Gothenburg, Oslo). It shows temperature, weather icons, sunrise/sunset times, and updates the background dynamically based on conditions. Weather data is cached using localStorage.
